    <h1> Cricket is a Gentelmen's GAME</h1>
     <p>
        
        Cricket is called a gentleman’s game because many early cricketers in England, where the game originated, came from affluent backgrounds, and were considered to hold virtues of a ‘Gentleman’. In modern times, the game has retained this title due to the values associated with it; especially the idea of fair play.
    n 1806 a cricket fixture began in England which was made up of those classed as amateur players (Gentlemen) and professional cricketers (Players) which helped foster use of the terms.

The difference between the two sides came out of the class structure of the era. The Players traditionally came from working-class backgrounds and earned a living from playing cricket for club and county teams. The Gentlemen, meanwhile, largely came from the upper class, or upper-middle class, and supposedly made nothing out of playing beyond their expenses.

The Gentlemen v Players match grew in popularity from the mid-19th century onwards, although the battle-hardened professional players would typically easily beat their amateur counterparts.

The match continued right up until 1962 when the MCC – the custodians of cricket – abolished the status of ‘amateur’ cricketers and thus all those who played first-class cricketers to be deemed professionals. Of the 274 matches Gentlemen v Players fixtures there 125 victories or the players, 68 for the Gentlemen with 80 draws and 1 match was tied.

    <h1> The Spirit of game</h1>
<p>
    Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents.
